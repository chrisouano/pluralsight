# Pluralsight Course Files

This repository houses course files for Pluralsight courses created by James Bannan.
The courses are available [at Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/james-bannan "Pluralsight").

## Update: July 2021

I've added assets for the demos in the course [<strong>Mastering Microsoft Azure Resouce Manager Architecture</strong>](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/mastering-microsoft-azure-resource-manager-architecture).

You can find these assets in the [mastering-azure-resource-manager-architecture](mastering-azure-resource-manager-architecture) folder, which contains all the resources for running through the various deployments of different solution architectures. These demos are manual in nature, leveraging both [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure).

## Update: August 2020

I've added assets for the demos in two new courses:

- [<strong>Developing Local Chef Cookbooks on Windows</strong>](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/developing-local-chef-cookbooks-windows)
- [<strong>Developing Local Chef Cookbooks on Linux</strong>](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/developing-local-chef-cookbooks-linux)

You can find the assets for these courses in the appropriate folders, which are [chef-windows](chef-windows) and [chef-linux](chef-linux) respectively. These courses on Chef don't require any Chef Server infrastructure, just the latest version of [Chef Workstation](https://downloads.chef.io/tools/workstation), [Hashicorp Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for Test Kitchen as well as some form of virtualisation layer, such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

## Update: September 2019

I have added assets for the demos in the course <strong>Manage Kubernetes Infrastructure</strong>, which is part of the Azure DevOps Engineer Learning Path.

You can find these assets in the [azure-devops-kubernetes-infrastructure](azure-devops-kubernetes-infrastructure) folder, which contains resources for demoing deployments of AKS using both [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) as well as deploying a [multi-tier microservices application](https://microservices-demo.github.io/) to AKS.
